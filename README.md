# iOS Recipe App

## Why was this made?
This is a simple app built for a take home project for an iOS position at Fetch.

### How was this made?
I used SwiftUI and MVVM to fetch recipes from this api https://d3jbb8n5wk0qxi.cloudfront.net/recipes.json#. 
I then decoded the json and cached the images for better app performance. Implementing swift testing to ensure
the quality of the network response and complete data.

### Steps to Run the App
Run the app in xcode simulator or connect your physical device. Search recipe by name and sort by cuisine. The list has a pull down to refresh function added as well.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I chose to focus on the UX side of the project making sure the app was simple to use with no stuttering. On the code side I focused on
architecture making sure my code is easy to read and easy to scale.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I was busy this week so I decided to spread my work throughout two days, adding up to about 5 hours of total work including planning, coding and everthing in-between.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I was planning on a different desgin approach where I would use a LazyVGrid instead of a list, however I ran into some problems with layout and decided to keep it simple
in order to not waste time on a 'smaller' portion of the project.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I believe the weakest part is the design, in my mind there wasn't enough for me to add to the empty spaces within the app. I also would put more time into constructing my tests and expanding on it.

### External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?
None used.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I'm glad to have the oppurtunity to showcase my skills, as a developer I am always trying to learn more and more each day. Whatever decision is made with my application I hope to continue to further my skillset to become a more competent developer. If there is anything you think I could do better with please let me know, even something small I am alway happy to learn. Thank you for your time I hope whoever is reading has a great day and happy holidays.
