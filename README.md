# iOS Recipe App

## Why was this made?
This is a simple app built for a take home project for an iOS position at Fetch.

### How was this made?
I used SwiftUI and MVVM to fetch recipes from this api https://d3jbb8n5wk0qxi.cloudfront.net/recipes.json#. 
I then decoded the json and cached the images for better app performance. Implementing swift testing to ensure
the quality of the network response and complete data.
